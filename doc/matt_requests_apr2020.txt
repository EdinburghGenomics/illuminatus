Matt wants some very reasonable things...

1) In the /v/ listing when looking at historical reports, add the pipeline status to the
table. It may be possible somehow to push this into the 'Description' column?
Otherwise, force it into the directory name, but note this messes up the 'New version available'
indicator so meh.

OK there is a neat way to do this - see:
web1:/var/runinfo/illuminatus_reports/test/190515_A00291_0147_AHJV72DMXX/v/.htaccess

Now my idea is to build this file on-the-fly when pushing to the server, probably by adding a description.txt
file to each report. Now the question is can I do this for existing reports or is that too much to ask?

Yeah here's a hacky but effective way to do it:

gawk 'BEGIN{print "IndexOptions DescriptionWidth=*"}{ if (match($0,"<dt>Pipeline Status:</dt><dd>(.+)</dd>",m) && match(FILENAME,"([^/]+)",f) ) print "AddDescription \""m[1]"\" "f[1] }' */multiqc_report_overview.html > .htaccess

So I'll add this to the uploader script. I can also run it retroactively.

2) Add the Experiment name to the initial e-mail not just the report. (Easy!)

This is in summarize_lane_contents.py and should only need changes to that file.

3) Make the pass/fail/marginal colours in MultiQC not be red+green. This goes for the thing at
the top, and the lines too.
