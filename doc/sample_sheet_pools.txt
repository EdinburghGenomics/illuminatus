The design calls for demultiplexing to be done on the basis of:

Project->Pool->Library

Where, obviously, a pool has many libraries.

If there is not actually a pool then we'd use a consistent placeholder, like 'NoPool',
which is fine.

If the library is a RAD pool then the Library name will be something like 12345ZZPool01
which is also fine.

Likewise, the pool can be 12345ZZSuper01 - at this point we're not trying to interpret
what this means. Logic further down the pipe could spot these values and extract further
info from the LIMS accordingly.

But just now (18 May 2017) the Sample Sheets are putting files directly under the project
dir. Let's have a look at run 170221_K00166_0183_AHHT3HBBXX and see what is to be done.

Lane,Sample_ID     ,Sample_Name,Sample_Plate,Sample_Well,I7_Index_ID,index   ,Sample_Project,index2  ,I5_Index_ID,Description
1   ,10503BD0412L02,           ,HHT3HBBXX   ,           ,TP-D7-001  ,ATTACTCG,10503         ,AGGATAGG,TP-D5-003  ,

produces:

10503/10503BD0412L02_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz
10503/10503BD0412L02_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz

Michael says that the Sample_ID is used to name the subfolder but here it's clearly going into the filename.
What if I add a fake sample name, Pool01?

To do this:
$ cd /lustre/home/tbooth2/test_fastqdata/170221_K00166_0183_AHHT3HBBXX/demultiplexing
edit do_demultiplex.sh
copy and edit SampleSheet.csv
$ ~/workspace/illuminatus/BCL2FASTQRunner.sh

OK, now it makes a folder with the Sample_ID and puts the Sample_Name in the filename, as Michael said. If
I try to set all the Sample_IDs to Pool01 I get an error.

So, what to do? Well, I really want to set the Sample_ID as "Pool01/10503BD0412L02" but as a second-best option
I'll set it to "Pool01__10503BD0412L02" which is just as easy to split out in the postprocessor.

Note that at the same time I've determined that I can add "--barcode-mismatches: 0" to the [Settings] section of the
SampleSheet and bcl2fastq doesn't care. Or even better, I can insert my own [bcl2fastq] section.

So for testing, I'm going to go with the naming convention given above and leave Sample_Name blank. I could also
allow Sample_Name to be set and deal with that??

Then I need to check that there is no issue with the names being too long: 10000AApool01__10000AA0000L01
Nope, seems fine.
