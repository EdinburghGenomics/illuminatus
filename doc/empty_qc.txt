Run 191011_M01270_0096_000000000-CLVY8 failed to process as no clusters at all passed the filter,
so I marked the run as aborted.

Not a real problem, however it raises the possibility that we might see a NovaSeq run where one
lane is usable and the other has no clusters at all. In that case the pipeline would fail and it
would be a problem.

Therefore I'm going to slim down 191011_M01270_0096_000000000-CLVY8 and see if I can 'fix' it.
