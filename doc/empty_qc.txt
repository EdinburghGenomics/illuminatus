Run 191011_M01270_0096_000000000-CLVY8 failed to process as no clusters at all passed the filter,
so I marked the run as aborted.

Not a real problem for this run, however it raises the possibility that we might see a NovaSeq run where one
lane is usable and the other has no clusters at all. In that case the pipeline would fail and it
would be a problem.

Therefore I'm going to slim down 191011_M01270_0096_000000000-CLVY8 and see if I can 'fix' it.

Do I want to make a lane report with no lanes at all?

Possibly. I could look for Stats.json files rather than FASTQ files.

OK, it seems that if I simply get the list of demultiplexed lanes by globbing for Stats.json files
rather than FASTQ files then I get an empty report with no further tinkering. So I'll stick with
this.

Note I'm actually globbing both and combining the list of lanes. My reasoning is that this will make
any inconsistencies more obvious. Not that there should be inconsistencies.
