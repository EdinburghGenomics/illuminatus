From initial investigation, if looks like the new SP flowcells are actually just
S1 flowcells (same tile layout) but with restricted capacity. In which case I can no longer
rely in reading RunInfo.xml to get the flowcell Type. I need to read RunParameters.xml
and let FlowCellMode override the value. Yep I can do that.

Needs to be done in both RunMetaData.py and summarize_lane_contents.py
