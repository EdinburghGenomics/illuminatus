Ragic is great. Let's replace all the Clarity stuff with Ragic. Yay!

1) Sample sheet fetch can be replaced with samplesheet_from_ragic.py.

I'll worry about how to get the sample sheets to the MiSeq later. It will probably
require me running a little thingy on egcloud.bio.

Sample sheet fetch is gooooooo!

2) Get the project name from Ragic too. Easy.

in summarize_lane_contents.py I was importing (line 570):
from illuminatus.RTQuery import get_project_names

so now I'll make an equivalent function in illuminatus.ragic

Done. And now you just do from "illuminatus import get_project_names" so that
summarize_lane_contents.py does not care from whence it gets the names.

Probably all the logic of having the project names as an env var should be busted out
here too, but I'll not worry about that today.

3) Push the run ID back into Ragic. Fairly easy.
