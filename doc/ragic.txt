Ragic is great. Let's replace all the Clarity stuff with Ragic. Yay!

1) Sample sheet fetch can be replaced with samplesheet_from_ragic.py.

I'll worry about how to get the sample sheets to the MiSeq later. It will probably
require me running a little thingy on egcloud.bio.

2) Get the project name from Ragic too. Easy.

3) Push the run ID back into Ragic. Fairly easy.
