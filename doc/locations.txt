Considerations regarding where things go:

On GSEG, BCL raw data will go into /lustre/seqdata/<runid>
Demultiplexing will happen in /lustre/fastqdata/<runid>/demultiplexing
Final files will be copied to /lustre/fastqdata/<runid>
QC will be performed in /lustre/runqc/<runid>
md5 files will be created in /lustre/runqc/<runid>/md5sums but this will be shifted
to /lustre/fastqdata/<runid> once they are generated.

The postprocessor script will handle renaming of the files and hence will move them
out of the demultiplexing subdirectory.

If for some reason (backups?) we don't want the demultiplexing folder in the fastqdata folder,
we'll just get driver.sh to make a symlink instead of a directory and leave the worker scripts
unmodified.
