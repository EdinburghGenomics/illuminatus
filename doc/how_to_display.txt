# At the moment, I'm just looking to push the reports to web1. In future, we can maybe have something more
# sophisticated with versioned reports being kept, maybe with delta packing...

# Anyway, a shell function:

pushrep (){ (
    cd "$1"
    runname="`basename $PWD`"

    # Note the proxy setting in ~/.ssh/config which lets both ssh
    # and rsync through monitor transparently.
    dest=web1:/var/runinfo/illuminatus_reports

    rsync -drvl --include='multiqc_*' --exclude='*' QC/ $dest/$runname/
    ssh ${dest%%:*} ln -s multiqc_report_overview.html ${dest#*:}/$runname/index.html
) ; }

So, to make this actually work. I can put this in a script and run it after running the QC.
It should take a setting from the environment, just like everything else.
I need to consider how to handle failure. Uploading of final QC should be a fail but uploading
of intermediate QC is just a warning.

On 24/01/18 - OK, I have upload_report.sh and I'm happy with how I've integrated it into driver.sh
which passes the report URL to RT and also handles intermittent failures up to pushing the final
report (which is considered a QC fail).

I still think that having a server-side system which properly handles the versions and does some
delta-packing and deduplication is what we really need, but for now I can tackle the immediate
problem that reports are being clobbered and keep them on web1.
Or, actually, I'll keep all the reports in fastqdata/<run>/multiqc_reports and sync the whole tree
over.

Strategy is:

1) Have a directory in /lustre/fastqdata/180115_A00291_0010_BH5N22DMXX/multiqc_reports

( not under QC because I want to be able to delete the QC directory without losing the history )

2) upload_report.sh moves the files into there before sync-ing the whole lot up to web1

3) The files are put in directories like v_0001 and there is a "current" symlink. index.html
   sends users to the right place if they just want the latest report. Oh, but then the index
   masks the list of versions. So make it v/0001 instead. Yep, that works.
   Oh, and make the symlink "latest" not current.
