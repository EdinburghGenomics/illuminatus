# At the moment, I'm just looking to push the reports to web1. In future, we can maybe have something more
# sophisticated with versioned reports being kept.

# Anyway, a shell function:

pushrep (){ (
    cd "$1"
    runname="`basename $PWD`"

    # Note the proxy setting in ~/.ssh/config which lets both ssh
    # and rsync through monitor transparently.
    dest=web1:/var/runinfo/illuminatus_reports

    rsync -drvl --include='multiqc_*' --exclude='*' QC/ $dest/$runname/
    ssh ${dest%%:*} ln -s multiqc_report_overview.html ${dest#*:}/$runname/index.html
) ; }
