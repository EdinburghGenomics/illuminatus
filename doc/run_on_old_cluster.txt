# To make this thing run on the old cluster:

1) Bootstrap Snakemake in the VEnv, copying the recipe from Hesiod

DONE

2) Add a toolbox_oldcluster and fix up all the things.

Working on it...
I've made the interpretation of the TOOLBOX setting more sane.

3) Roll a new environ.sh

DONE

4) Ensure I have access to RT and clarity (there may be SSL issues?)

The .dotfiles are already in place.

5) Profit!

Just now I have two unit test failures. Hmmm. (But hooray for unit tests!)
OK those are fixed. One was simple. The other really weird - see test_e2.sh
for a simplified version of the changed BASH behaviour.
