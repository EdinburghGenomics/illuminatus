The main development documentation is on the Wiki at:

https://genowiki.is.ed.ac.uk/display/GenePool/RunQC+demultiplexing+pipeline+software+requirement+specification

and in the various child pages. Anything for discussion or related to the formal specification
should be posted there.

In this folder there may be some assorted developer notes and draft documentation.
