Some of the 10x runs only have 26 cycles in the first read. The plan is that we should be
able to get a well dups number for these by going to the second read, but of course this means
the scan triggered after read1 will have to fail.

* Runs that are affected so far:

19, 20, 25, 31

* What the users see in the report:

No well dups number in the overview table

* What actually happens under the hood:

LANES_TO_SAMPLE is set to an empty list, and QC/welldups/2500summary.yml is never generated.

Because of the way the Snakefile is constructed, if the logic were changed this file should
be generated, but I do need to test things.

* How to test this thing?

Really what we want is to fake a NovaSeq run reaching READ1_FINISHED and then seeing if:

1) The first attempt to make the welldups fails
2) After all reads are in, the attempt succeeds
3) The correct cycles are used in the calculation

So I can do this by copying run 180412_A00291_0020_BH2YTVDRXX. First I'm going to update
slim-a-run.sh to deal with NovaSeq runs.
