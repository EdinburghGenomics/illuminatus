OK, things I need to work on 1.7...

Test on ~/test_seqdata/210322_A00291_0342_AH5VY5DRXY - this needs revcomp override set to 1.

Do it with no override and check:L

1) The barcodes report shows the best guesses
2) The PhiX alignment is shown
3) The sample sheet fragment is available

Then add pipeline/index_revcomp.lane1.OVERRIDE and check it works and check the metadata looks OK
and check the sample sheet frag looks ok. Yo.
