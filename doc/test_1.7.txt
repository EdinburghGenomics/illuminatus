OK, things I need to work on 1.7...

Test on ~/test_seqdata/210322_A00291_0342_AH5VY5DRXY - this needs revcomp override set to 1.

Do it with no override and check:

1) The barcodes report shows the best guesses - see below
2) The PhiX alignment is shown - Yep
3) The sample sheet fragment is available - Yep

Then add pipeline/index_revcomp.lane1.OVERRIDE and check it works and check the metadata looks OK
and check the sample sheet frag looks ok. Yo.

Yes, it does.

The barcodes report only shows after QC. It's not a big deal but really it could show after demultiplexing
as the files is there. For this I'll need to do some fairly significant modifications to the MultiQC_edgen
plugin as it only activates if the legacy report is there. Really it should activate on the .txt file and
then add the legacy report if it sees it. This would mean we get to see the info earlier.

Not a huge ask, but let's not delay the release for it.

OK there were problems anyway so I did the fixes as noted. And it looks very good.

So, release.
