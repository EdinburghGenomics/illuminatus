After successful demultiplexing, the QC needs to trigger.

Also, we need MultiQC reports to be generated at appropriate times.

Questions, questions:

When do we need MultiQC reports run?

    - On initial run creation
    - On run completion
    - Right after demultiplexing (interop finished)
    - After any QC process

Should md5 generation be part of the QC pipeline or separate?

    - Assume part-of just now, but bear in mind the files need to be pushed
      back into the fastqdata dir, just as the bcl2fastq logs really belong in
      the runqc directory.

When do we need QC to run?

    - After demux,
    - or re-demux

What should the QC driver look like?

    - A single Snakefile that runs in a fastqdata dir and writes results to a QC
      subdirectory and md5sums to an md5sums subdirectory. If these are set as symlinks
      beforehand then they can be pointed elsewhere, but do I need to do this?
      Maybe it's better to keep the QC in with the FASTQ and to clean it up as needed.

MultiQC can then mine the QC subdirectory for goodies.
