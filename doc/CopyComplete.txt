Soooo...

Up until now, one of the easiest things in the Illuminatus pipeline was deciding if
a run was ready to demultiplex. If RTAComplete.txt is there, then we go.

But recently a couple of runs have failed, because a CBCL file was missing.

So it seems that wating for RTAComplete.txt is not enough. In NovaSeq there is another
file, CopyComplete.txt. But this comes in an hour after RTAComplete.txt, and it seems
that we were only missing the CBCL file by a few minutes.

11:10 240722_A00291_0576_AHVHL5DMXY/Data/Intensities/BaseCalls/L002/C222.1/L002_2.cbcl
12:43 240722_A00291_0576_AHVHL5DMXY/CopyComplete.txt

So, our choices are:

1) Wait for CopyComplete.txt and add 90 minutes to processing time.
2) Add a short delay (5 mins?) to after RTAComplete.txt appears (yuk!)
3) Look explicitly for the CBCL file
4) Something else??

I can't see a decent option 4. I think we need to do option 3. Fortunately we already have
code for Read1 ready detection.
