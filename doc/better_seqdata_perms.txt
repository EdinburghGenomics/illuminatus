## Tighter permissions for /lustre/seqdata

On Friday (6th Sep 2019), Frances went to abort a failed MiSeq run, as per SOP004.
This asks the operator to remove the stale files from /lustre/fastqdata (ie. the output directory) but due
to a typo Frances instead removed the run from /lustre/seqdata (ie. the input directory). While this in itself
was not a major issue, a slightly different variation of the typo could have removed multiple runs. It also
goes against our standard procedure and would have to be an NC under our new quality assurance regime.

I propose 2 changes:

1) In the SOP, state that removal of the old directory should always be done by moving the directory to trash

  $ mv -vt trash <rundir>

rather than by

  $ rm -r <rundir>

This affords an opportunity to undo mistakes and is generally a good habit.

2) Review the permissions on /lustre/seqdata. Currently all the files written by the sequencer are in group
eg-bioinfo and thus writeable by all bioinformaticians. I think the group ownership should be "eg-pipeline" and
that all bioinformaticians should be removed from this group (this change has to be made by the EPCC team).
Anyone needing this permission can still use the gsegadmin or root or pipeline accounts.

Problems (and non-issues) with this:

* Hard-linking to files is affected by permissions. Files on fastqdata will need to have their
  group changed so that linking is still permitted. Files on seqdata do not need to be linked
  so this is not an issue.

* The pipeline directory needs to be writeable as several situations require this. We can ensure
  that Illuminatus creates this directory to be owned by eg-bioinfo.

* We will no longer be able to write .keep files to the run directories. I'd suggest instead using
  pipeline/keep as the file, since the pipeline dir will be writeable.

* We will no longer be able to make SampleSheet.csv.OVERRIDE. Obviously we could log in as 'pipeline' to do
  this, but then we can't see who made the file. Instead I suggest that the OVERRIDE should be in the pipeline
  dir, which as noted above is writeable.

* Logs are kept in fastqdata so that's fine.

* pipeline_settings.ini is not used in any normal situation. I'd suggest that any run needing this treatment
  should have the group ownership changed to eg-bioinfo.

Tasks:

1) Request EPCC to remove all our regular accounts from the eg-pipeline group (actually this needs to happen
   last but they will need to co-ordinate the change)

EPCC say we can do this ourselves - see below.

2) Alter Illuminatus to fix the group ownership on the "pipeline" directories that it creates to eg-bioinfo
   (or rather, to avoid hard-coding, to the same group as the output dir). Also to look for
   pipeline/SampleSheet.csv.OVERRIDE. DONE in the 1.4 (UMI) branch

   Once the group ownership on /lustre/fastqdata (just the top level) is fixed and the documentation is
   done this can be released.

   Actually no it also depends on the new auto-deletion code (3) since we'll be adding keep files to the
   pipeline dir for auto-keep.

3) Alter the auto-deletion system to respect pipeline/keep files instead of the old .keep files, and move
   the existing files. DONE in GIT.

   The altered code looks for both so we can release it now, then move the files and change the docs.

4) Recursively change the group ownership on /lustre/seqdata to eg-pipeline (aside from import_staging)
   and the ownership of /lustre/fastqdata to eg-bioinfo. Also clean up cron_logs which is redundant.

   We should be able to do /lustre/fastqdata right now. Then all the new runs should just end up
   being owned by eg-bioinfo. After this we can update Illuminatus, then fix the perms on seqdata,
   then fix the group perms.

5) Review and test the standard procedure for importing runs from clinical (probably this will need to
   be done under the pipeline account from now on, but arguably it should be done via this account on
   gseg-dt in any case?)

   I think this just has to be done as 'pipeline'. We need a new work instruction for this in any case.
   Once Mark has signed off 11 and 13 I'll hit him with this one.

6) Review the procedures for fiddling with the sample sheet, noting that SampleSheet.csv.OVERRIDE
   should be in the pipeline dir now.

7) Review the procedure for aborting runs, noting the correct way to trash an aborted run. - DONE in new BW-11

## Changing groups on GSEG

So I'm going to remove Hywel from the eg-pipeline group as a first test.

[tbooth2@gseg-login0 ~]$ id hdunnda
uid=40021(hdunnda) gid=40023(hdunnda) groups=272531(genepool),318871(eg-bioinfo),318882(eg-pipeline),40023(hdunnda)
[tbooth2@gseg-login0 ~]$ groups hdunnda
hdunnda : hdunnda genepool eg-bioinfo eg-pipeline

[tbooth2@gseg-login0 ~]$ sudo usermod -G genepool,eg-bioinfo hdunnda
[sudo] password for tbooth2: ****
[tbooth2@gseg-login0 ~]$ groups hdunnda
hdunnda : hdunnda genepool eg-bioinfo

Now in about 5 minutes this should filter down to the nodes. I'm keeping an eye on r2i1n7.

[tbooth2@r2i1n7 ~]$ watch -n 30 groups hdunnda
