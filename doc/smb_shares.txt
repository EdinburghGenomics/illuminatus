In order to write data into Illuminatus, the sequencers have to be able to see the SBM-mounted directory.
(For early testing we had a hacky rsync copy process going - see sync_and_driver.sh)

This is exported from gseg-login0 (of course!) by setting up a SAMBA share with very basic user/pass auth.

See the notes at the end of /etc/samba/smb.conf, but basically the /lustre/seqdata area is exported read/write
to the pipeline user and the password has been set to the same one used on Isilon (Tw...) using
sudo smbpasswd -a pipeline.

So to connect, map drive L (for Lustre!) to seqdata on gseg-login0.genepool.private and use the context
\gseg\pipeline and the password ...

I've also added a read-only option. For this I've hijacked the gsegadmin account as this already has the
required permissions. Again I needed to set an smbpasswd for this user, and also edited smb.conf as
per https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/using_samba/ch09.html
