OK I think I want to extract this from the InterOP as part of the summarize_yield.py. Do I want to add to
the actual yield table? I think yes. Er, actually no. OK cool.

Then in MultiQC_edgen, where do I need to edit? OH, nowhere. I need to add this to
summarize_lane_contents.py. Cool 2.0.

Try running this on any run directory...

export PATH="$HOME/workspace/illuminatus:$PATH"
summarize_lane_contents.py --yml - --add_in_yaml yield=<(summarize_yield.py .)

Then with '--mqc -' instead.

Yes this should be a fairly simple change to the gnuplot invocation. Might leave if for next time, though.
