The unassigned report is something of a mess. However, rather than re-write it
just now I'm going to make the old version work in the new pipeline.

This is the version that also checks the LIMS for barcodes which are not
explicitly listed in the configuration file. In future this should be all of them.

We have one problem - the counters need to run on the cluster as the job is
reasonably substantial, but the database fetch can only happen on the login node.
Therefore I need one job that fetches and dumps the barcodes, and another that
loads them in and does the scan. Not too hard, really.

Here is how the old script is called in the pipeline:

gzip -d -c /ifs/seqarchive/171023_K00166_0291_AHM2WGBBXX/171023_K00166_0291_AHM2WGBBXX_5_unassigned_1.sanfastq.gz | /ifs/software/linux_x86_64/Illumina_pipeline_scripts/tags/v1.9.9/count_barcodes_in_unassigned_reads3.pl -flagtablestart -noprogress -numtooutput 30 -cutoff 1500 -sortby count -out '/ifs/runqc/171023_K00166_0291_AHM2WGBBXX/QC/171023_K00166_0291_AHM2WGBBXX_5_unassigned_1_counts_of_unassigned_barcodes.stdout' -reportfile '/ifs/runqc/171023_K00166_0291_AHM2WGBBXX/QC/171023_K00166_0291_AHM2WGBBXX_5_unassigned_1_counts_of_unassigned_barcodes'  -hiSeqRun4000

Then to tack on the percentages (not done on the cluster)...

count_barcodes_in_unassigned_reads3.pl -noprogress -in /ifs/runqc/171023_K00166_0291_AHM2WGBBXX/QC/171023_K00166_0291_AHM2WGBBXX_1_unassigned_1_counts_of_unassigned_barcodes  -addnumlanepercent 341081494 -reportfile /ifs/runqc/171023_K00166_0291_AHM2WGBBXX/QC/171023_K00166_0291_AHM2WGBBXX_1_unassigned_1_counts_of_unassigned_barcodes_percent_of_lane

So the first thing is to have a mode that fetches and saves the barcodes and quits. I can get Snakemake to run this
once per project.

Actually, no, the first thing is to get DBD::Pg installed on the login node. This should be easy with YUM.
Ensure that the script doesn't try to load the DBI modules when not in fetch mode.

Done and done and done. Barcodes are dumped and re-loaded. Note that you have to set the hiseq 4000 mode
at the point of first loading the barcodes, as well as when scanning. I can't be bothered to sort this
issue right now.
