The lims_query.py script is not part of the design. For now I'm using it to
work out how to get various bits of info from the LIMS. Probably this will
end up being split into a utility library and a front-end at some point,
and combined with stuff that Michael is working on.

This raises the question of how do we deploy Illuminatus. At present you just
checkout from GIT and run the scripts. You satisfy dependencies by installing
them into you local Python, which on our machines is the shared VEnv in
/lustre/software/python.

If I make a basic setup.py, then I can create a clean VEnv in this directory,
pip-install the dependencies into the VEnv, and then activate this to tinker
with. Let's have a setup_venv.sh for now.
