Recently, the sample sheet fetcher failed and left a run in a state
where it had to be purged and restarted from scratch. The standard redo mechanism
should function here.

Let's test:

1) Slim a MiSeq run, break she sample sheet fetcher, run

env SAMPLESHEETS_ROOT=broken ./driver.sh

2) See what messages come back

Looks good - fails on scan-new-run

3) Try to redo the run

State persists as failed. Why?

Because a run can't be slated to redo until read1 is complete.
I added a condition where a run can redo if nothing started at all.

4) Make that work
5) Repeat for the fetcher failing after a redo.
6) What happens? Can we now re-redo?
