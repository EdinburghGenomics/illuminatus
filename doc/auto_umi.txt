We're getting several projects where there is a UMI in the first index read. The pipeline handles this
nicely but the sample sheets currently produced by Clarity don't actually work and need overriding.

The proper fix here is to fix the SSG in Clarity. Or to bypass Clarity entirely and just have our
customers provide a sample sheet in Excel format. I'm tempted to workaround it by editing
bcl2fastq_setup.py but no this really needs fixed at the LIMS level, and I'm not touching the SSG
code unless I'm forced to.

So, we'll let this sit for now. In the meantime, I'll keep working on umi_checker/umi_checker.py
