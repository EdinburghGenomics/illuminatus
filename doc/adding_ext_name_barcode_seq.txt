We want to see the external sample names and the barcode sequences in the report.
Both are slightly problematic. The latter less so, since we have the info in the
sample sheet and also (if need be) in the bcl2fastq log. ... Hang on, scrub that -
we have it in Stats.json. I can just add it as a feature to the bcl2fastq module.

There is one question over whether we want to revcomp the second index to for 4000/X
runs to show the barcode in canonical format. I suspect not - we want the index in
the same way it appears in the sample sheet. We could also do a reverse-lookup of
well-known codes so that for the Illumina barcodes we just see the name. I can
suggest this at the next meeting. For now, just add the codes, using the syntax
'AAAA+AAAA' to match the FASTQ headers (actually this is what we see in Stats.json. Awesome).

- Done in MultiQC and added to config

Adding the external names is more problematic, since we can't put these into the
sample sheet (because we can't robustly quote them or guarantee length) so I'll
need to snag them from the LIMS. But I'm snagging from the LIMS in any case so
whotevaaaa.

This needs to be poked into the General Statistics table - see
"plot_type: generalstats" in http://multiqc.info/docs/#data-as-part-of-multiqc-config
Good news - we can apparently do this without adding another custom module.

...

Ah, I just realised I need to add the pool name too. Let's look at that tomorrow.
I can snag it out of the Stats.json too, I think.
