Preliminary work for how I plan to do this is here in ~/Pictures/apng on my own laptop.

Currently (1.0.3) the pipeline calls:

{TOOLBOX} interop_plot_flowcell {input}/.. > {output}

I thought this gave the average intensity over all cycles but apparently no it just gives
the cycle 1 intensity.

The title of the image is always "<FCDI> Intensity" even if you apply the --filter-by-cycle=
filter.

The output file is set to '.._flowcell-Intensity.png' due to the way I call the script, and in
multiqc_edgen/modules/edgen_interop/edgen_interop.py I just allow this file to be made and then
snag it out of the temp dir. I'm going to need to do something more sophisticated.

Also can I produce an averaged image? It's going to be do-able but hacky.

So, this actually turned out to be even more complicated but what I did was:

1) Got the snakefile to emit intensity for all cycles to a single file, flowcell_all.interop_plot

2) Made the edgen_interop plugin in MultiQC_Edgen recognise this specific file and run gnuplot
   so as to produce a stack of images (for some reason I had to run gnuplot multiple times but
   Python POpen can handle this fine).

3) Made a fudged version of apngasm called apngasm-noopt that disables inter-frame optimisations
   (since this stops us playing the frams out-of-order and also has issues with triggering the
   canvas security traps on Chrome)

4) Made a fudged verion of apng-js-bundle.js that can display frames of these de-optimised apng
   files out-of order

5) Back in MultiQC_Edgen, applied various mungings to the gnuplot commands for example to force
   the scale from 50 to 300 so the colours are comparable.
