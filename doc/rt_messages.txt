The Illuminatus pipeline has to manage communication regarding the progres of the run.
Aside from logging, it does this by sending messages via RT. All messages will be sent
via the rt_runticket_manager.py script.

See the "Progress reporter" and "Error reporter" sections on
https://genowiki.is.ed.ac.uk/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=319660973

Subject: Run <runid>
Content:
  Ticket for tracking execution of the Illumina pipeline for run 170120_K00166_0169_AHH2F2BBXX.

  QC reports for this run will appear at:

    <qc_page>
Triggers-on: new->*


Subject: Run <runid>. Run page create on the Wiki.
Content:
  This had the Samplesheet report, which includes info from the project page on the wiki,
  specifically the actual project name in the link to the project page.
  Need to see if we can make an equivalent link to the LIMS.

  Also needs a link to the sample sheet, which may or may not be in the LIMS. I think we need to
  provide it for inclusion in the MultiQC report.
Triggers-on: Sample sheet available.

** Should probably do this on ticket creation. We also want a mini report when lanes are
  re-demultiplexed.

What try with ./rt_runticket_manager.py?

1) Retrieve ticket #2020 for run 161004_K00166_0134_AAAAAAAAAA

DONE

2) Add a comment to that ticket, and see if I get an email.

DONE. RT test does not seem to be routing mail, but that's OK.

3) Add a reply, with/without a subject.

Hmmm. Seems one-time reply is not supported by the API, or at least not by the wrapper.
Need to probe this. Checking out the Rt code from GIT on GSEG...
