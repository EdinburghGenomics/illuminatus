With moving to per-lane demultiplexing, I realise that the housekeeping code
in BCL2FASTQRunner.sh is just getting silly. Most of this is handled by Snakemake
already, so why not just use it?

So, switch to a Snakefile which generates, as final output, a
demultiplexing/Stats/DemuxSummaryF1L1.txt file. Then have the Snakefile
run Preprocessor to get the script it needs to run.

Preprocessor will need to be altered to generate scripts for one lane at a time.

Hmmm - I see that some of the files in Reports and Stats are shared per run. I
thin I'll need to demux into separate directories.

So:

for N in lanes:
    demultiplexing/do_demultiplexN.sh
    demultiplexing/laneN/

So, TODO:

1) Preprocessor to make 1 lane at a time.

2) --mismatches being set per lane correctly

3) New Snakefile to run the stuff: --config lanes="1 2 3"
