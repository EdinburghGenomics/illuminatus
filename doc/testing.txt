Unit tests for all components of the pipeline are in the test/ dir, but
what about doing a full test run on a cut-down dataset?

Firstly, you need a checkout of the Illuminatus code, and ensure that
you ran the 'activate_venv' script to make a suitable Python3 environment.

Then, you need a cut-down dataset to run through the pipeline.
The script for making these is test/end_to_end/slim_a_run.sh, eg:

$ ./test/end_to_end/slim_a_run.sh 170221_K00166_0183_AHHT3HBBXX ~/seqdata_test

Then, you need to set some parameters for driver.sh:

$ export MAINLOG=/dev/stdout
$ export SEQDATA_LOCATION=~/seqdata_test
$ export FASTQ_LOCATION=~/fastqdata_test
$ export RT_SYSTEM='none'

Ensure that the FASTQ_LOCATION actually exists:

$ mkdir -p ~/fastqdata_test

You can force the driver to look at only one run, or supply a glob pattern to match:

$ export RUN_NAME_PATTERN='170221_K00166_0183_AHHT3HBBXX'
$ export RUN_NAME_PATTERN='17????_K00166_*'

When running in test mode with those settings:

* Logs go to the screen (or into ~/fastqdata_test/<runid>)
* RT messages get skipped
* New sampleSheet will not be fetched as the slim_a_run.sh makes a SampleSheet.OVERRIDE
