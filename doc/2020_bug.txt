I've noticed that some of the old scripts assume that runs begin with a '1'.
Obviously from next year this won't be true.

To test Illuminatus and my own data processing scripts (qc_tools_python) let's
take a run (191021_A00291_0223_AHM77MDMXX) which is already slimmed and:

1) Make a copy and rename it to 201021_A00291_2020_AHM00MDMXX

2) Re-run Illuminatus to process the slimmed run

3) DRY_RUN a QC of project 11868

4) DRY_RUN a delivery of project 11868

As I'd hoped, all is well. So if we see any problems we can blame it on Berinski.
