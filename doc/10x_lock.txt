So we have a problem with 10x. If the runs are not processed immediately they get deleted.

The obvious answer is to always process 10x immediately.

Automating this is not easy - we'd need more metadata and it's not supposed to happen until
the run is signed off.

The easiest technical fix is to '.keep' anything that looks like it has 10X data. There may
be some false positives but this is far less a problem than accidental deletion.

Detevting the kept runs and removing them (or removing the .keep files) is simple with a grep.

So, a script that:

1) Loads the 10x barcode list.
2) Load the Stats.json for each lane
3) Reports the number of 10x barcodes found
