I have the feeling there are already some deployment notes but I can't find them.
(Yes I can - /lustre/home/pipeline/illuminatus/notes.txt)

The main pipeline, on CRON, will deploy to the pipeline account.

Once things stabilise, we'll tag releases in GIT, but for now it's going to be a matter
of stopping any running pipeline jobs, pulling from GIT, updating the VEnv, and
then restarting.

See /lustre/home/pipeline/illuminatus/notes.txt for details and commands.
