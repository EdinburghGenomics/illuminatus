The NovaSeq makes big files. Really big files.

For things like PhiX runs, we may well have to demultiplex by Swath to arificially get smaller
output files. This will give us 8 (pairs of) files per lane, rather than 1. But can I do it?

1) Snakefile.demux and dependent files

We can't just run 8 processes in parallel, as all the file names will collide.
We can either run as if there are 8 virtual lanes, or else we can run bcl2fastq
8 times per job and shuffle the results in between. The former seems the most
sensible, but do the lab want to think that way? They may have to!

How do we name the output? We have always assumed that lane numbers are numeric but
now we have to have a new naming scheme. 1A, 1B, 1C or 1S1, 1S2, 1S3 or ???
Either way it's going to break some things.

Good news is the QC should be simple since it just gathers up the files for the
specified lane. I'd need to change my Snakefile.qc to correctly extract the lane.
Thing is, if we have separate tabs in the report per-lane then we would need the
InterOP data per-swath which we are lacking. Or else I could combine the reports
per-lane and then I'd need to split out the samples to 8 virtual samples or else
numerically combine the data.

Ick, it's not fun. Lets see what we can do with our big data files before we start this
messing around. If we want to run more things (like bcl2fastq) over a subset of reads maybe
we can do the subset one using whatever method is in fastq_screen - this saves reading
the file multiple times.
