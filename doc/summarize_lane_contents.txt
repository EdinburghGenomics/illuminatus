The script was 'summarize_samplesheet.txt' but it's actually going to need to fetch
extra info from the LIMS :-

Full project names
Loading concentration (not yet availaible)
Loaded PhiX % (not yet availaible)

So I'm renaming it summarize_lane_contents.py and adding the following arguments:

--from-yml = take the specified yml as input
--yml = output yml to the specified file
--txt = output text (for e-mail) to the specified file
--tsv = output tsv (for table rendering) to the specified file

As this info will be recycled we want it in serialised (YML) form as well as text,
so I'm following the same idea as collate_bam_stats.py - the script can both fetch
and format the info but the two features are decoupled.
