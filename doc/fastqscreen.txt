So we definitely want FASTQscreen in the new pipeline.

The old pipeline uses a very old version and it seems to be having some memory issues.  Here
is the command that is run:

PATH=/path/to/bowtie-1.1.2:/fluidfs/f1/software/linux_x86_64/Illumina_pipeline_scripts/software_dependencies/perl/pipeline_current/bin:$PATH
/path/to/fastq_screen_v0.4.2/fastq_screen
--aligner bowtie
--conf /path/to/fastq_screen.conf_bowtie1 (which is /ifs/software/linux_x86_64/fastq_screen/fastq_screen_v0.4.2/fastq_screen.conf_bowtie1)
--threads 1 --quiet --subset 1000000
--bowtie '--trim3 100'
--outdir /fluidfs/f1/runqc/171019_A00291_0006_BH57JWDMXX/QC
--outfile 171019_A00291_0006_BH57JWDMXX_1_reads1and2
--seqcount 239901922
--paired 'foo_1.sanfastq.gz' 'foo_2.sanfastq.gz'

And the config file mostly defines the libraries to search. In fact, with --threads
set on the command line this is literally all it defines.

I think this should exist outside
of Illuminatus, since the databases are outside of Illuminatus, so let's have a script called:

/lustre/software/illuminatus_toolbox/fastq_screen

This will set the --aligner and --bowtie and --conf (libraries) options as we like them,
and invoke /lustre/software/fastq_screen/fastq_screen_v0.11.3/fastq_screen.

I think the config file should then live in /lustre/references/fastqscreen/fastq_screen.conf_bowtie1_20171122,
and everything should also be linked in this directory, so dangling symlinks become obvious.
** Nope - can't do that, because the configuration needs to have the REAL path to the index. **

And the actual genomes can live under genomes or under production_qc. All will need to be indexed with
bowtie and bowtie2. (Note the comment in the old code that bowtie2 has out-of-memory issues)

Also note that MultiQC looks for fastqscreen files called *_screen.txt, so make them with this name
and see if the results are any use.

Tasks:

1) Install bowtie on GSEG - done (used pre-built 1.2.1.1)
2) Install newest fastqscreen on GSEG - done (0.11.3 back on Oct 17)
3) Install the config file as above - done and edited.
4) Copy over and clean up all genomes - done
5) Put the illuminatus_toolbox/fastq_screen script in place
6) Test it on some inputs large and small

$ mkdir ~/fastq_screen_test
$ /lustre/software/illuminatus_toolbox/fastq_screen --threads 2 --subset 10000
