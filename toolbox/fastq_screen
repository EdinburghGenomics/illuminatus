# Wrapper to run the preferred version of fastq_screen with the preferred
# selection of databases and configuration.
# Note  that we expect the conf file to define databases only!
# Note2 that the newer version of fastq_screen neither accepts nor expects
# a --seqcount parameter, and the subsample size will be approximate.

# Caller should set --threads and --subset 1000000 (or whatever)
# Can also say --quiet to reduce log spew
# You probably also want to add --bowtie '--trim3 {N}' where N=max(readlen-50,0)
# but to do this you need to know what readlen is.
